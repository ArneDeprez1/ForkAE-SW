# 8-bit implementation

This directory contains an 8-bit implementation of the different instances of ForkAE. 

A specific instance can be selected by uncommenting the correct line in `api.h`.

An example makefile and the NIST test vector generation software are included. 
The `make` command compiles the files and runs the test vector generation.
